    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will ask you to generate *feature contribution explanations* of ML model predictions using the Pyreal python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature contribution explanation** shows how much each feature contributed to an ML model's prediction. Contributions are negative if a given feature value decreased the model prediction, and positive if it increased the model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a model that predicts the sale price of a house. A feature contribution explanation may tell you that the price increased by \\\\$8,000 because the house is in a good neighborhood, and decreased by \\\\$1,000 because it has two bedrooms. This information could be shown as a table with the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Value | Contribution |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Neighborhood Quality | Good | 8000 |\n",

    "## How to Use Pyreal\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyreal is python library that generates ML model explanations such as feature contribution explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Pyreal, you must first make a RealApp object, which takes in data, a trained ML model, and a list of transformers. We will provide any data, model, or transformers you need to complete the tasks in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use the RealApp to generate explanations, and then use Pyreal's **visualize** module to make graphs of the explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⭐ Run the sample code below for an example of how to use Pyreal. You can use/copy this code throughout the study as needed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use Pyreal, you can consult the [documentation](https://dtail.gitbook.io/pyreal). However, the sample code below should be sufficient to complete this user study.\n"
